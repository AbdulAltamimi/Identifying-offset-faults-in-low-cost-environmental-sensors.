# Identifying-offset-faults-in-low-cost-environmental-sensors.

Overview
In this challenge, your task is to develop a classification model that can detect offset faults in low-cost air quality sensors. You'll be provided with time-series readings from various sensors, and your model must predict whether each sensor reading is faulty (1) or not (0).
